# ParcelDeliverySystem
A Parcel delivery system which works by distributing parcels among trucks in a fleet, which then take them to their respecive destination. Wrote an algorithm which distributes 
parcels among the trucks randomly; wrote another greedy algorithm that minimised the number of cities travelled by a truck, summed over all trucks in the fleet.
